Similarly, the recent mandatory lockdowns proved to be quite fruitful for the electrical engineer and product designer, Sam March who likes to build electrical gadgets from scratch in his leisure time. After&nbsp;<a href=\"https://imgur.com/gallery/FSBwD3g\" target=\"_blank\">making a smartwatch last year</a>, the guy made a GPS-enabled smart glass from scratch this time around.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A few months back, in the summers, March was walking down a scenic street with his smartphone giving him directions for his destination.

And whenever he needs to reach a location while enjoying the view,&nbsp;<strong>he just opens up the app, feeds the destination in it, and wears his smart glass</strong>. So, with the destination fed in the app, he does not even have to take out his phone from the pocket.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The GPS-enabled wearable communicates with the app and gives directions to reach the destination via different colored lights on either side of its frames. So, while wearing the glass,<strong>&nbsp;the user will be able to easily spot the light cue whenever a turn comes or he/she reaches the destination</strong>. The lights blink blue for turns and green when you reach the destination.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>You can check out the working of the smart wearable in the video below.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>March worked on this project for a pretty long time. He developed every component of the smart-wearable, from building the frames to designing the circuit boards.

We in fact did a detailed piece on&nbsp;<a href=\"https://beebom.com/how-truecaller-works-privacy-concerns/\">Truecaller&rsquo;s data-gathering practice</a>&nbsp;and found that there are ample safeguards and user choice. And no, contrary to popular opinion, the company is not based out of China.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>That said, now Truecaller is looking ahead and adding some great features to make the calling experience even better. The recently-announced&nbsp;<a href=\"https://truecaller.blog/2020/10/21/call-reason-the-evolution-of-caller-id/\" target=\"_blank\">Call Reason feature</a>&nbsp;on Truecaller allows you to let the recipient know why you are calling them. It&rsquo;s not as innovative as&nbsp;<a href=\"https://beebom.com/google-assistant-can-now-hold-calls/\">Pixel&rsquo;s Hold for Me feature</a>, but useful enough for most users. So if you want to learn how to use the Call Reason feature on Truecaller, follow along.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Use the Call Reason Feature on Truecaller</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Before we begin, let me tell you the Call Reason feature on Truecaller is currently available only on Android and rolling out worldwide. It will be coming to iOS early next year. Also, you need to be on&nbsp;<strong>version 11.30</strong>&nbsp;to be able to use this feature. So go ahead and update the Truecaller app on the Play Store. All that said, here are the steps to follow.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>1. First of all, open Truecaller and tap on the hamburger menu. Here, open &ldquo;Settings&rdquo; and move to &ldquo;<strong>General</strong>&ldquo;.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"call reason on truecaller\" src=\"https://beebom.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Untitled-design-1-1.jpg\" style=\"height:560px; width:506px\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>2. Next, you will find the option &ldquo;<strong>Call Reason</strong>&ldquo;. Here, enable the toggle and it will take you to the setup page.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"Use the Call Reason Feature on Truecaller\" src=\"https://beebom.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/2-12.jpg\" style=\"height:560px; width:506px\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>3. Now,&nbsp;<strong>tap on the reasons</strong>&nbsp;to activate those pre-defined messages. If the buttons are not working then go back and enable the toggle again. This time, it should work fine.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"Use the Call Reason Feature on Truecaller\" src=\"https://beebom.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/1-Use-the-Call-Reason-Feature-on-Truecaller.jpg\" style=\"height:560px; width:252px\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>4. If you want to&nbsp;<strong>edit the pre-defined reasons</strong>&nbsp;and add your own reasons then simply tap on the 3-dot menu and you will find an &ldquo;Edit&rdquo; option. Tap on it and add your custom call reason on Truecaller.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"Use the Call Reason Feature on Truecaller\" src=\"https://beebom.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/2-Use-the-Call-Reason-Feature-on-Truecaller.jpg\" style=\"height:560px; width:252px\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>5. Now, you will be greeted with feature activation. Tap on &ldquo;<strong>Got It</strong>&rdquo; and you are done.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://beebom.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/3-Use-the-Call-Reason-Feature-on-Truecaller.jpg\" style=\"height:560px; width:252px\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>6. Next, open Truecaller and place a call. Instantly,&nbsp;<strong>a call reason pop-up will appear</strong>. You can simply choose any one of them or enter your own text by tapping on the &ldquo;Type Custom&rdquo; button. If you want to permanently remove the Call Reason prompt for a particular contact then tap on &ldquo;Hide For This Person&rdquo;.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://beebom.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/4-5.jpg\" style=\"height:560px; width:252px\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>7. Finally, the recipient will see the&nbsp;<strong>call dialog with Call Reason</strong>, front and center. This way, the recipient will know the reason why you are calling and can increase the chances of call pick-up, especially for unknown numbers. That&rsquo;s one cool idea, right?</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em><strong>Note:</strong>&nbsp;The recipient must be having the Truecaller app installed to see Call Reason.&nbsp;</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://beebom.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Untitled-design-2.jpg\" style=\"height:560px; width:562px\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Use Call Reason on Truecaller for Better Communication</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>So that is how you can use the Call Reason feature on Truecaller. I am happy that this sought-after feature is not behind the paid plan and everyone from e-commerce agents to service-based companies can take advantage of this feature.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Anyway, that is all from us. But what do you think about the Call Reason feature on Truecaller? Let us know in the comments section below.

', '<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>While&nbsp;<a href=\"https://beebom.com/siri-vs-google-assistant-vs-hound/\">Google Assistant is pretty powerful</a>&nbsp;and does a lot of things right, its in-app integration with third-party apps has been patchy at best. However, that seems to be changing now as Google has started tightening the screw and bringing deeply tied, in-app actions to Google Assistant. With the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://beebom.com/google-assistant-better-integration-android-apps/\">recent update</a>, you can now invoke in-app actions from third-party apps such as opening the Explore tab on Instagram, updating the profile picture on&nbsp;<a href=\"https://beebom.com/whatsapp-tricks-new-features/\">WhatsApp</a>, and more. So if want to browse and add third-party shortcuts to Google Assistant then follow along.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Add Third-party Shortcuts to Google Assistant</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>1. Open the Google app and move to the &ldquo;More&rdquo; menu at the bottom bar. Now, navigate to&nbsp;<strong>Settings -&gt; Google Assistant</strong>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"Use Third-party Shortcuts with Google Assistant\" src=\"https://beebom.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/1-4.jpg\" style=\"height:560px; width:506px\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>2. Now, tap on the &ldquo;<strong>Services</strong>&rdquo; tab and open &ldquo;Shortcuts&rdquo;.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"Use Third-party Shortcuts with Google Assistant\" src=\"https://beebom.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/3-Add-Third-party-Shortcuts-to-Google-Assistant.jpg\" style=\"height:560px; width:252px\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>3. Here, you will find all the third-party shortcuts that Google Assistant supports on your smartphone. Keep in mind, the shortcuts are populated based on the apps you have installed on your device. Now,&nbsp;<strong>tap on &ldquo;+&rdquo;</strong>&nbsp;to add your favorite shortcuts and you will get a confirmation from Google Assistant.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"Use Third-party Shortcuts with Google Assistant\" src=\"https://beebom.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/3-2.jpg\" style=\"height:560px; width:506px\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>4. You will find all your third-party shortcuts under the &ldquo;<strong>Your Shortcuts</strong>&rdquo; tab. For example, here I have added &ldquo;New Keep Notes&rdquo;, &ldquo;Twitter Messages&rdquo;, &ldquo;Explore Instagram&rdquo;, etc.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"Use Third-party Shortcuts with Google Assistant\" src=\"https://beebom.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/6-Add-Third-party-Shortcuts-to-Google-Assistant.jpg\" style=\"height:560px; width:252px\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>5. Now go ahead and say &ldquo;<strong>Hey Google, check news</strong>&rdquo; and it will directly take you to Twitter&rsquo;s search tab where you can find all sorts of news trending on Twitter. I also tried other variations like &ldquo;check Twitter news&rdquo; and it took me to the same page. Basically, you don&rsquo;t need to remember the correct phrase. Just say something closer to the original command and the Assistant will process it correctly.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://beebom.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/2-3.jpg\" style=\"height:560px; width:506px\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Run In-app Actions of Third-party Apps with Google Assistant</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>So that is how you can add and run third-party shortcuts with Google Assistant. To be honest, this sort of feature was already there on Google Assistant, but it was not deeply tied or required extensive support from Google.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For instance, recently, Google Assistant added support for&nbsp;<a href=\"https://beebom.com/google-assistant-whatsapp-video-voice-calls/\">WhatsApp calls</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://beebom.com/google-assistant-send-audio-messages-contacts/\">audio messages</a>. It&rsquo;s good to see Google housing all these third-party integrations in one place so users can browse and add their favorite shortcuts.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>That said, we would love to see Google allowing users to tinker with any in-app action and not just the predefined ones, similar to the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://beebom.com/manage-folders-shortcuts-app-ios-14/\">powerful Shortcuts app on iOS</a>. Perhaps, that may be coming in the future. Anyway, that is all from us.

There are times when Apple takes inspiration from Android.

At this point, both the ecosystems are quite polished and have matured by leaps and bounds, especially Android. However, there is one aspect that makes iOS stand out and that is privacy controls. Every year, Apple adds new privacy controls to iOS which makes Android users wanting for more. So in this article, we bring you a handy guide on how to get iOS 14 features on Android including privacy and other useful features. So without further ado, let&rsquo;s get started.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Get the Best iOS 14 Features on Android</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Here are the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://beebom.com/best-ios-14-hidden-features/\">best iOS 14 features</a>&nbsp;that you can get on Android right now. You can go through the list below and click on the link to move to the corresponding feature.

Camera and Mic Indicator</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>During the release of iOS 14, Apple made some big announcements regarding privacy and one feature that stood out was camera and mic indicator. On iOS 14, whenever an app uses the camera or mic,&nbsp;<strong>a dot indicator appears</strong>&nbsp;at the top of the screen. This is done to alert the user that an app is snooping on you. Further, you can find the app name in the Control Center and uninstall it right away.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"1. Camera and Mic Indicator iOS 14 Features on Android\" src=\"https://beebom.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/a-11.jpg\" style=\"height:416px; width:640px\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>So if you want this iOS 14 feature on Android,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://beebom.com/access-dots-brings-ios-14-cam-mic-indicator-dots-android/\">you can&nbsp;<strong>use Access Dots</strong></a>&nbsp;(<a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=you.in.spark.access.dots\" target=\"_blank\">Free</a>, offers in-app purchases). The app allows you to get a similar indicator as iOS 14 for mic and camera usage. The best part is that you can even customize the colors and change the size and position of the dot. So go ahead and get this awesome iOS 14 feature on Android by using the Access Dots app.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>2. App Library Folders</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>After years of pestering, Apple finally caved in and brought an app drawer on iOS 14. Similar to Android launchers, now a separate pane houses all the apps on iOS 14. But that is not all about the new app drawer. There is something called App Library which&nbsp;<strong>automatically organizes all of your apps</strong>&nbsp;into a folder depending on the app category.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"2. App Library\" src=\"https://beebom.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/b-7.jpg\" style=\"height:529px; width:640px\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>To get the App Library feature on Android, you just need to download a third-party launcher such as Microsoft Launcher (<a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.microsoft.launcher&amp;hl=en_US\" target=\"_blank\">Free</a>) or&nbsp;<strong>Lawnchair</strong>&nbsp;(<a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=ch.deletescape.lawnchair.plah&amp;hl=en_US\" target=\"_blank\">Free</a>) or Nova (<a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.teslacoilsw.launcher&amp;hl=en_US\" target=\"_blank\">Free</a>, $4.99). All these launchers allow you to create app folders right into the app drawer. However, keep in mind, these launchers don&rsquo;t sort the app automatically so you will have to do it on your own. If you want automatic categorization then you can use Poco Launcher (<a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.mi.android.globallauncher&amp;hl=en_US\" target=\"_blank\">Free</a>), but instead of app folders, it offers you separate windows.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>3. SMS Filtering</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>With the announcement of iOS 14, Apple added a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://beebom.com/ios-14-messages-app-update-improvement/\">big feature to its messaging app</a>. Now, spammy texts, OTPs, and&nbsp;<strong>promotional messages will be filtered out</strong>&nbsp;and put in separate folders. This completely changes the messaging experience, especially in India where you get so many junk texts every day.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"3. SMS Filtering iOS 14 Features on Android\" src=\"https://beebom.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/1-17.jpg\" style=\"height:560px; width:506px\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>On Android, SMS filtering is not available natively, but you can install a third-party messaging app that filters texts automatically. You can&nbsp;<strong>install SMS Organizer</strong>&nbsp;(<a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.microsoft.android.smsorganizer&amp;hl=en_US\" target=\"_blank\">Free</a>) by Microsoft to get iOS 14&rsquo;s SMS filtering feature on Android. It&rsquo;s one of my favorite apps on Android and you must give it a try.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>4. Back Tap</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>To make iPhones more accessible and easier to use, iOS 14 brings something called Back Tap that allows you to&nbsp;<strong>invoke an action by double-tapping on the back</strong>&nbsp;of the phone. You can just double-tap on the back and take a screenshot or&nbsp;<a href=\"https://beebom.com/google-assistant-commands/\">ask Google Assistant</a>&nbsp;some questions. That&rsquo;s quite cool, right?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>To get this iOS 14 feature on Android, you might have to wait a bit longer. Google is developing a similar feature for Pixel phones which might get released with Android 11. However if you want it right now,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.xda-developers.com/tap-tap-brings-ios-14-android-11-back-tap-gesture-any-android-device/\" target=\"_blank\">Quinny899 from XDA</a>&nbsp;has come to the rescue. He has&nbsp;<a href=\"https://beebom.com/tap-tap-app-brings-back-tap-gestures-to-your-android-phone/\">developed an&nbsp;<strong>app called &ldquo;Tap, Tap&rdquo;</strong></a>&nbsp;that allows you to double-tap on the rear and invoke actions of your choice.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"4. Back Tap\" src=\"https://beebom.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/2-15.jpg\" style=\"height:560px; width:506px\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>If you are wondering how it works, well, the app is using gyroscope and accelerometer readings and comparing it with&nbsp;<strong>machine learning models</strong>&nbsp;that Google has trained for Pixel devices. It works surprisingly well on my OnePlus 7T and if you want iOS 14&rsquo;s Back Tap feature on Android then Tap, Tap is here for you. You can download the app from&nbsp;<a href=\"https://forum.xda-developers.com/android/apps-games/app-tap-tap-double-tap-device-gesture-t4140573\" target=\"_blank\">here</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>5. Privacy information on the App Store</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>To make people aware of privacy malpractices, on iOS 14, Apple will be displaying privacy information of each app on the App Store in easily understandable language. For example, before you download an app, you can find out&nbsp;<strong>what data the app can use to track you</strong>&nbsp;and what data the app will have access to. This goes a long way in understanding what sort of privacy policy does the app practice so that you can either choose to install an app or discard it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"5. Privacy information on the App Store iOS 14 Features on Android\" src=\"https://beebom.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/3-12.jpg\" style=\"height:560px; width:506px\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>While Android does not have this feature natively, you can&nbsp;<strong>install an app called Exodus</strong>&nbsp;(<a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.eu.exodus_privacy.exodusprivacy&amp;hl=en_US\" target=\"_blank\">Free</a>). It scans all your installed apps and displays all the trackers that the app is using to track you. Apart from that, you can also find out all kinds of permissions that app has been granted by default. This will allow you to understand how much data the app is seeking from you. So go ahead and get this iOS 14 feature on Android to strengthen your privacy.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>6. Temporary Permission</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Apple brought &ldquo;Allow once&rdquo; permission dialog last year with iOS 13 and now we are hearing that Android 11 will sport this feature. On top of that, Android users might also get&nbsp;<strong>auto-revoke permission</strong>&nbsp;feature. The way it works is, if you have not used an app for some time, sensitive permissions will be automatically revoked.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"6. Temporary Permission\" src=\"https://beebom.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/4-8.jpg\" style=\"height:560px; width:506px\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>However, not everyone is going to receive the Android 11 update so if you want this excellent privacy feature on your Android right now, you can&nbsp;<strong>install Bouncer</strong>&nbsp;(<a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.samruston.permission&amp;hl=en_US\" target=\"_blank\">$1.99</a>). It allows you to grant temporary permission to an app and the moment you exit from the app, the permission is automatically revoked. That&rsquo;s really great, right? So go ahead and get this iOS feature on Android right away.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>7. In-App Search</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>With iOS 14, Apple has overhauled how the search works. You can now perform in-app searches which basically means that you can&nbsp;<strong>search for your library or songs</strong>&nbsp;in Apple Music right from the search bar. No need to open the app and look for the content.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"7. In-App Search iOS 14 Features on Android\" src=\"https://beebom.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/5-2.jpg\" style=\"height:560px; width:506px\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>If you want this iOS 14 feature on Android then you can&nbsp;<strong>install Sesame</strong>&nbsp;(<a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=ninja.sesame.app.edge&amp;hl=en_US\" target=\"_blank\">Free</a>, offers in-app purchases). The app is one tap away from searching for your music, contacts, system settings,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://beebom.com/how-to-create-instagram-stories-on-android-and-iphone/\">Instagram stories</a>, favorite apps, and more. Simply put, you will have access to everything in just one tap.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>8. Assign Reminders</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>With iOS 14, you can&nbsp;<strong>assign reminders to people</strong>&nbsp;you share lists with. And they will be reminded according to the schedule. This feature is amazing and can help you split tasks and accomplish them without any fail. You can also get this iOS 14 feature on Android by just using the Google Assistant.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"8. Assign Reminders\" src=\"https://beebom.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/c-3.jpg\" style=\"height:560px; width:252px\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>If you are part of a family group then you just need to say &ldquo;<strong>Hey Google remind X to&hellip;</strong>&rdquo; and the reminder will be assigned to the said person. You can find your family group from the Google App -&gt; 3-dot menu -&gt; Settings -&gt; Google Assistant -&gt; Your People. And to customize assignable reminders, move to the &ldquo;Services&rdquo; tab under Google Assistant and open &ldquo;Assignable Reminders&rdquo;.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>9. Website Privacy Report</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>During the announcement of iOS 14, Apple discussed many new features of Safari and how it has been finetuned for a more privacy-friendly experience. Among the many features of Safari, I liked the Website Privacy Report. Basically, you will be able to&nbsp;<strong>see what trackers and cookies the website is using</strong>&nbsp;and the cross-site trackers that Safari has blocked.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"iOS 14 Features on Android\" src=\"https://beebom.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/9.jpg\" style=\"height:560px; width:506px\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>On Android, Chrome does not offer such a report which is disappointing (learn how to&nbsp;<a href=\"https://beebom.com/how-to-get-safari-privacy-features-chrome/\">get Safari features on Chrome</a>). Anyway, if you move to&nbsp;<strong>DuckDuckGo</strong>&nbsp;(<a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.duckduckgo.mobile.android&amp;hl=en_US\" target=\"_blank\">Free</a>) or Firefox (<a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.mozilla.firefox&amp;hl=en_US\" target=\"_blank\">Free</a>) or Brave (<a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.brave.browser&amp;hl=en_US\" target=\"_blank\">Free</a>) on Android then it shows you all the cookies and trackers that the browser has blocked. DuckDuckGo even gives a privacy rating to the websites you visit. In tandem, if you want iOS 14&rsquo;s Website Privacy Report on Android then the DuckDuckGo browser would be a great choice.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>10. Conversation Mode</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>With the iOS 14 release, Apple announced a new Translate app that looks really promising. It&nbsp;<strong>has offline capabilities</strong>&nbsp;and language detection is on point. What caught my attention was Conversation Mode which allows you to say something, and the Translate app transcribes the voice on the screen, followed by the translated audio. It works really well.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\" iOS 14 Features on Android 10. Conversation Mode\" src=\"https://beebom.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/d-1.jpg\" style=\"height:560px; width:252px\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>If you want something like Conversation Mode on Android then Google Assistant will be of your great help. Google Assistant comes with a dedicated Interpreter Mode which works very similar to iOS 14&rsquo;s Conversation Mode.&nbsp;<strong>Just say &ldquo;interpreter mode&rdquo;</strong>&nbsp;to Google Assistant and you will have your voice transcribed on the screen with translated audio. As an aside, you can learn more about&nbsp;<a href=\"https://beebom.com/apple-translate-vs-google-translate/\">Apple Translate vs Google Translate</a>&nbsp;from our in-depth article.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Bonus: Block Clipboard Access</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>iOS 14 has made many internal revisions to protect your privacy. For example, now you get a notification on iOS 14 whenever an app&nbsp;<strong>tries to access the clipboard</strong>. You can have anything &mdash; password, sensitive information, banking details &mdash; copied to your clipboard, and apps getting easy access to it is not right.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Android 10 has already restrictions in place as to what apps can access the clipboard and what cannot. However, if you are&nbsp;<strong>running an older version of Android</strong>&nbsp;then you can find out apps with clipboard access and you can even block them from reading your clipboard again. Here are the steps to follow.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>1.&nbsp;<a href=\"https://beebom.com/how-to-install-adb-windows-mac/\">Set up ADB</a>&nbsp;and move to&nbsp;<code>adb shell</code>. Now, execute the below command to&nbsp;<strong>find all the apps</strong>&nbsp;with clipboard access.</p>\r\n\r\n<pre>\r\ncmd appops query-op --user 0 READ_CLIPBOARD allow</pre>\r\n\r\n<p>2. Note down the package name of the app that you want to block and&nbsp;<strong>execute the below command</strong>. This will block the app from reading the clipboard again. If you want to enable it then just replace&nbsp;<code>ignore</code>&nbsp;with&nbsp;<code>allow</code>.</p>\r\n\r\n<pre>\r\ncmd appops set &lt;packagename&gt; READ_CLIPBOARD ignore</pre>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://beebom.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/abc-2.jpg\" style=\"height:238px; width:641px\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Get iOS 14 Features on Android Right Now</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>So that is how you can get iOS 14 features on Android without much tweaking or rooting your device. It&rsquo;s no secret that every year Apple brings new features to iOS and sets the bar high for Android and the rest of software makers. I love the fact that Apple pushes hard for protecting user privacy and that revitalizes Google to do more when it comes to the privacy front. Anyway, that is all from us.

If yes, follow along to manage your shared photos and videos via iMessage.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>View All Photos in Messages Threads on iOS</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>iMessage lets you check out the shared images and clips of each conversation thread. So, depending on your needs, you can dive into a specific conversation thread and view the file size of each image. Moreover, you also have the option to save an image and even share it.</p>\r\n\r\n<ol>\r\n	<li>Launch the&nbsp;<strong>Messages app</strong>&nbsp;on your iPhone and iPad.</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"Tap on the Messages app on iPhone\" src=\"https://beebom.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Tap-on-the-Messages-app-on-iPhone.jpg\" style=\"height:560px; width:259px\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>2.

In this article, we are going to cover the note pinning feature that allows users to quickly access important notes. So, here is how you can pin notes in Apple Notes on iPhone and iPad.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Pin Notes in Apple Notes App on iPhone, iPad, and Mac</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Before we proceed with this guide, don&rsquo;t forget to check our other guides on Apple notes where we have discussed features like&nbsp;<a href=\"https://beebom.com/lock-notes-apple-notes-mac-iphone/\">locking individual notes in Apple Notes</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://beebom.com/how-access-apple-notes-lock-screen-iphone-ipad/\">accessing notes from lock screen</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://beebom.com/share-notes-app-folders-iphone-ipad-mac/\">sharing Notes app folders</a>, and more.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>With that out of the way, let&rsquo;s get to our tutorial, shall we? There are multiple ways to pin notes in Apple Notes, and we will cover all of them below. So, launch the Apple Notes app, and let&rsquo;s begin.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Table Of Contents&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Pinning a Note in Apple Notes App on iPhone and iPad</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>1. The easiest way to pin a note in Apple Note is by&nbsp;<strong>swiping from left-to-right on a note</strong>. You can either swipe the whole way to pin the note or swipe halfway and then tap on the pin icon.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"Pin Note by Swiping on iPhone\" src=\"https://beebom.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Pin-Note-by-Swiping-on-iPhone.jpg\" style=\"height:560px; width:518px\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>2. You can also pin a note by<strong>&nbsp;touching and holding a note</strong>&nbsp;(Haptic Touch) to open the context menu and selecting the &ldquo;Pin Note&rdquo; option.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"Pin Note using haptic touch on iPhone\" src=\"https://beebom.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Pin-Note-using-haptic-touch-on-iPhone.jpg\" style=\"height:560px; width:259px\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>3. To pin an open note,&nbsp;<strong>tap on the three-dot menu on the top-right</strong>&nbsp;and then tap on the &ldquo;Pin&rdquo; button.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"Pin Note using share menu on iPhone\" src=\"https://beebom.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Pin-Note-using-share-menu-on-iPhone.jpg\" style=\"height:560px; width:518px\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Pinning a Note in Apple Notes App on Mac</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>1. To pin a note on Mac,&nbsp;<strong>swipe left to right on the note with two-fingers</strong>. Just like on the iPhone, you can either swipe the whole way or stop mid way and then tap on the pin icon.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"Pin Note by Swiping on Mac\" src=\"https://beebom.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Pin-Note-by-Swiping-on-Mac.jpg\" style=\"height:305px; width:640px\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>2. You can also pin a note by selecting it and then&nbsp;<strong>going to File -&gt; Pin Note</strong>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"Pin Note in Apple Notes using File Menu\" src=\"https://beebom.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Pin-Note-in-Apple-Notes-using-File-Menu.jpg\" style=\"height:299px; width:640px\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>3. The final way to pin a note on Mac is by&nbsp;<strong>right-clicking on the note and choosing the Pin Note option</strong>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"Pin Note by Swiping on Mac\" src=\"https://beebom.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Pin-Note-by-Swiping-on-Mac.jpg\" style=\"height:305px; width:640px\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Pin Notes at Top in Apple Notes App in iOS and macOS</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>As you can see, both iPhone (iPad) and Mac offer three different methods to pin a note. You can use any of the above methods that you remember to pin and unpin a note. For me, the easiest one to use and remember is swiping left to right on a note. Let me know your favorite method by writing in the comments below.</p>\r\n'),

If you are yet to use new Markup color tools in iOS 14 on iPhone and iPad, follow along to get started!</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Use New Markup Color Tools on iOS 14 and iPadOS 14</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Whether you want to&nbsp;<a href=\"https://beebom.com/evernote-alternatives/\">create a good-looking note</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://beebom.com/best-photo-editing-apps-iphone/\">edit your photos</a>, add some nice customization to screenshots, or even insert a digital signature to a PDF document, the Markup tool has a role to play. With the inclusion of several precision tools, it now offers you more flexibility to create attractive designs or&nbsp;<a href=\"https://beebom.com/best-pdf-editor/\">annotate PDFs</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>1. To get going, access the&nbsp;<strong>Markup icon</strong>&nbsp;from apps like Photos, Safari, and Notes. You can also access it from a screenshot and Share Sheet as well.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"Accessing markup tools in safari, screenshot, and notes\" src=\"https://beebom.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Accessing-markup-tools-in-safari-screenshot-and-notes.jpg\" style=\"height:560px; width:781px\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>2. I&rsquo;m going to bring it up from the&nbsp;<strong>Notes app</strong>. Simply open a note and then tap on the&nbsp;<strong>Markup icon</strong>&nbsp;at the bottom.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"Tap on the Markup button\" src=\"https://beebom.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Tap-on-the-Markup-button.jpg\" style=\"height:560px; width:259px\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>3. Next, tap on the&nbsp;<strong>color button</strong>&nbsp;at the bottom right corner of the screen to reveal all the new color tools.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"Tap on the color button at the bottom right corner of the screen\" src=\"https://beebom.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Tap-on-the-color-button-at-the-bottom-right-corner-of-the-screen.jpg\" style=\"height:560px; width:259px\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>4. You should see three tabs along the top:&nbsp;<strong>Grid, Spectrum, and Sliders.</strong>&nbsp;The Opacity slider is located along the bottom. Interestingly, there is also an option to&nbsp;<strong>save custom colors</strong>. To do it, tap on the&nbsp;<strong>&ldquo;+&rdquo; button&nbsp;</strong>at the bottom.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"Using new Markup tools in iOS 14\" src=\"https://beebom.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Using-new-Markup-tools-in-iOS-14.jpeg\" style=\"height:560px; width:259px\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>One of my favorite additions to the Markup tools is the super handy&nbsp;<strong>&ldquo;eyedropper&rdquo; tool</strong>&nbsp;located at the upper-left corner of the screen.

The company has introduced the long-awaited End-to-End encryption (E2E) on Zoom for both free and paid users which is great. ', '<p>After a year of&nbsp;<a href=\"https://beebom.com/zoom-video-conferencing-app-is-unsafe-says-home-ministry/\">security mishaps and controversies</a>, Zoom is finally getting back to track. The company has&nbsp;<a href=\"https://blog.zoom.us/zoom-rolling-out-end-to-end-encryption-offering/\" target=\"_blank\">introduced</a>&nbsp;the long-awaited End-to-End encryption (E2E) on Zoom for both free and paid users which is great. Earlier, Zoom had taken a controversial stand to not offer E2E encryption to free users, but after facing privacy backlash, the company&nbsp;<a href=\"https://beebom.com/zoom-end-to-end-encryption-all-users/\">quickly backtracked</a>. Now, you can enable End-to-End encryption on Zoom by validating your identity through a phone number. With all that said, let&rsquo;s go ahead and learn about Zoom&rsquo;s E2E encryption and how to enable it.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Enable End-to-End Encryption on Zoom</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>We have covered enabling Zoom&rsquo;s E2E Encryption for both individual users and groups and enterprise users in different sections. We have also mentioned some notable points that you should keep in mind. Use table of content below to quickly move to the section you want.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Table Of Contents&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Notable Points on Zoom&rsquo;s E2E Encryption</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Before moving to the steps, there are a few points that you should make a note of. With E2E turned on, you&nbsp;<strong>won&rsquo;t be able to use many of Zoom&rsquo;s features</strong>&nbsp;such as cloud recording, streaming, live transcription, join before host and more. Also, users won&rsquo;t be able to join an E2E meeting through the telephonic medium.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Zoom says as End-to-End encryption is currently in Technical Preview so it will take more than a year to bring all the features with ironclad encryption. Apart from that, both free and paid users have E2E support, but&nbsp;<strong>free users have to verify their identity</strong>&nbsp;through a mobile number or need to add a valid billing option.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Next, End-to-End encryption on Zoom is currently available on the official clients only. Basically, E2E encryption is available on the dedicated apps of&nbsp;<strong>Windows, macOS, Linux, Android, iOS and Zoom Rooms</strong>. As of now, E2E encryption is not supported on the web. Also, all participants must have E2E encryption enabled to join an E2E meeting.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Lastly, as we noted in our&nbsp;<a href=\"https://beebom.com/google-meet-vs-zoom-vs-microsoft-teams/\">Zoom vs Google Meet comparison</a>, End-to-End encryption is the same GCM encryption that was deployed earlier on Zoom. However, this time, the&nbsp;<strong>decryption keys are generated locally</strong>&nbsp;on users&rsquo; computers &mdash; instead of Zoom&rsquo;s servers &mdash; which was decrypting and managing the keys earlier. In tandem, the packets can only be decrypted at the receiver&rsquo;s end which makes it a secure End-to-End channel.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Enable End-to-End Encryption on Zoom for Individuals</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>1. You can enable End-to-End encryption on Zoom only&nbsp;<strong>through the web portal</strong>. So first off, open the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://zoom.us/profile/setting\" target=\"_blank\">Settings page of Zoom</a>&nbsp;and move to the &ldquo;Meeting&rdquo; tab.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://beebom.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/1-19.jpg\" style=\"height:208px; width:640px\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>2. Here, scroll down and&nbsp;<strong>enable the toggle</strong>&nbsp;for &ldquo;Allow use of end-to-end encryption&rdquo;.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"Enable End-to-End Encryption on Zoom (For Individuals)\" src=\"https://beebom.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/1-Enable-End-to-End-Encryption-on-Zoom-For-Individuals.jpg\" style=\"height:174px; width:640px\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>3. It will then ask for your&nbsp;<strong>phone number</strong>. Enter it and click on &ldquo;Send Verification Code&rdquo;.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"Enable End-to-End Encryption on Zoom (For Individuals)\" src=\"https://beebom.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/2-Enable-End-to-End-Encryption-on-Zoom-For-Individuals.jpg\" style=\"height:525px; width:572px\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>4. Next, enter the&nbsp;<strong>one-time code</strong>&nbsp;that you will receive on your phone number and click on &ldquo;Verify&rdquo;.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"Enable End-to-End Encryption on Zoom (For Individuals)\" src=\"https://beebom.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/3-Enable-End-to-End-Encryption-on-Zoom-For-Individuals.jpg\" style=\"height:282px; width:577px\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>5. Finally, the option for End-to-End encryption on Zoom will be enabled. Now, simply select &ldquo;End-to-End encryption&rdquo; as the&nbsp;<strong>default encryption type</strong>&nbsp;and click on &ldquo;Save&rdquo;. You are done.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"Enable End-to-End Encryption on Zoom (For Individuals)\" src=\"https://beebom.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/4-Enable-End-to-End-Encryption-on-Zoom-For-Individuals.jpg\" style=\"height:339px; width:640px\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>6. To verify if the Zoom meeting is End-to-End encrypted, you will find a green shield logo on the top left corner. Keep in mind, GCM encryption also has a green shield, but it features a checkmark sign. But with E2E enabled, you will find a&nbsp;<strong>padlock symbol</strong>&nbsp;inside the green shield along with a security code.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://beebom.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/a-6.jpg\" style=\"height:295px; width:388px\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Enable End-to-End Encryption on Zoom for Group and Account Admins</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>1. Open&nbsp;<a href=\"https://zoom.us/profile/setting\" target=\"_blank\">Zoom&rsquo;s Settings page</a>&nbsp;by clicking on the link and move to&nbsp;<strong>Account Management</strong>&nbsp;-&gt; Account Settings.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>2. Here, click on &ldquo;Meeting&rdquo; and move to the &ldquo;<strong>Security&rdquo; tab</strong>. Now, enable the toggle for &ldquo;Allow use of end-to-end encryption&rdquo;.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>3. Next, choose &ldquo;End-to-End encryption&rdquo; as the&nbsp;<strong>default encryption</strong>&nbsp;type and click on &ldquo;Save&rdquo;.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>4. If you want to make E2E encryption mandatory for all users in your group or account,&nbsp;<strong>click the Lock icon</strong>&nbsp;to confirm the changes. That&rsquo;s it.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Make Your Zoom Meetings Secure with E2E Encryption</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>So that is how you can enable End-to-End encryption on Zoom and make your web meetings secure from all kinds of security attacks. As the feature is in Technical Preview, many essential features are not available and that is understandable. So I would suggest you that use E2E encryption only when the meeting is extremely confidential. To get all the features, you will have to wait for quite some time. Anyway, that is all from us.

The feature was long due and users tied to the Google ecosystem were sorely missing the feature.', '<p>After&nbsp;<a href=\"https://beebom.com/google-meet-add-custom-background-raise-hand-other-new-features-soon/\">announcing</a>&nbsp;that custom background is coming to Google Meet earlier in June, finally, Google has&nbsp;<a href=\"https://beebom.com/google-meet-now-supports-custom-backgrounds-on-the-web/\">added support</a>&nbsp;for virtual backgrounds before the end of the year. The feature was long due and users tied to the Google ecosystem were sorely missing the feature. As we noted in our&nbsp;<a href=\"https://beebom.com/google-meet-vs-zoom-vs-microsoft-teams/\">Google Meet vs Zoom</a>&nbsp;comparison, Google Meet is way behind Zoom in terms of feature set. Thankfully, the gap is slowly closing. The custom background feature is available to both free and paid users. So if you are interested, follow our guide and learn how to use custom backgrounds on Google Meet.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Use Custom Backgrounds on Google Meet</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Before moving to steps, note that custom background on Google Meet is&nbsp;<strong>currently available only on the web</strong>. Google has stated that the feature will come to Android and iOS apps in the future. Apart from that, keep in mind, the custom backgrounds feature is not available to organizations that have opted for G Suite for Education plan. With that out of the way, let&rsquo; go through the instructions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>1. The process to use custom backgrounds on Google Meet is pretty straightforward. While you are on a video call, just click on the 3-dot menu on the bottom-right corner and select &ldquo;<strong>Change Background</strong>&ldquo;.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"use custom backgrounds on google meet\" src=\"https://beebom.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/1-use-custom-backgrounds-on-google-meet.jpg\" style=\"height:560px; width:362px\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>2. From here, you can choose any virtual background of your choice. You have the option to blur the background along with&nbsp;<strong>a variety of preloaded images</strong>&nbsp;ranging from cafes to libraries, beaches, and more.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"use custom backgrounds on google meet\" src=\"https://beebom.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/2-use-custom-backgrounds-on-google-meet.jpg\" style=\"height:360px; width:640px\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>3. If you want to upload your own custom background on Google Meet then simply&nbsp;<strong>click on the &ldquo;+&rdquo; button</strong>&nbsp;and select an image from your computer. That&rsquo;s it. Keep in mind, as of now, it does not support dynamic videos as custom backgrounds. Also, the image must be in JPG format and must not exceed the size limit of 16MB.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://beebom.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/3-use-custom-backgrounds-on-google-meet.jpg\" style=\"height:560px; width:398px\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Apply Custom Backgrounds on Google Meet</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>So that is how you can apply custom backgrounds on Google Meet. In my experience, the face detection and background separation on Google Meet was not as good as Zoom. That said, the blur background worked pretty well without any face trimming issues. Anyway, that is all from us. In case, you want to learn&nbsp;<a href=\"https://beebom.com/how-upload-change-background-microsoft-teams/\">how to change backgrounds on Microsoft Teams</a>&nbsp;then follow our linked guide.</p>\r\n'),

One of the reasons is no graphical user interface (GUI) for Linux App Store which prevents people from discovering and using&nbsp;<a href=\"https://beebom.com/best-linux-apps-chromebook/\">Linux apps on Chromebook</a>. However, there is a way to install a GUI App Store on Linux and here I am going to show you how to get it. In this article, we bring you an in-depth guide on how to install Flatpak and Snap App Store in Linux on&nbsp;<a href=\"https://beebom.com/what-is-a-chromebook/\">Chromebook</a>. Both these app stores are quite popular in the Linux ecosystem so you will be able to access a legion of popular Linux apps on Chrome OS. With all that said, let&rsquo;s go ahead and learn how to install a GUI app store in Linux on Chromebook.</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>\r\n	<h2>Install Flatpak in Linux on Chromebook</h2>\r\n	</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>While Flatpak has a significantly small repository of apps, it&rsquo;s&nbsp;<strong>supported officially on Chromebooks and the apps run quite well</strong>. And that&rsquo;s why we have mentioned Flatpak at the beginning of this article. Apart from that, Flatpak comes with its own library of essential packages and sandboxing tools so that is great. Now, let&rsquo;s go ahead and install Flatpak in Linux on Chromebook.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>1. Open the Terminal and&nbsp;<strong>run the below commands one by one</strong>. Flatpak will be installed within a few minutes.</p>\r\n\r\n<pre>\r\nsudo apt install flatpak\r\nsudo flatpak remote-add --if-not-exists flathub https://flathub.org/repo/flathub.flatpakrepo</pre>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"Install Flatpak in Linux on Chromebook\" src=\"https://beebom.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/How-to-Install-Flatpak-and-Snap-App-Store-in-Linux-on-Chromebook-GUI-3.jpg\" style=\"height:390px; width:640px\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>2.&nbsp;In case,&nbsp;<strong>your Chromebook shows some errors or displays &ldquo;Permission Denied&rdquo;</strong>&nbsp;then run&nbsp;<code>sudo su</code>&nbsp;first to get root access. It&rsquo;s equivalent to gaining Administrator Privilege on&nbsp;<a href=\"https://beebom.com/beginner-tips-for-windows-10/\">Windows PCs</a>. Following that, execute other commands one by one. Finally, Flatpak will be installed on your Chromebook.</p>\r\n\r\n<pre>\r\nsudo su\r\nsudo apt install flatpak\r\nsudo flatpak remote-add --if-not-exists flathub https://flathub.org/repo/flathub.flatpakrepo</pre>\r\n\r\n<p>3. Now that you have installed Flatpak successfully,&nbsp;<strong>let&rsquo;s install a GUI application</strong>&nbsp;so you can easily discover, install and manage Linux apps on Chrome OS. Run the below commands and it will install the GUI app store.</p>\r\n\r\n<pre>\r\nsudo su\r\nsudo apt install gnome-software-plugin-flatpak</pre>\r\n\r\n<p>4. After the installation, you will find a &ldquo;Software&rdquo; named app inside the Linux folder in the App Drawer. Open it and voila, there you have it. A&nbsp;<a href=\"https://beebom.com/best-linux-apps/\">GUI store for Linux apps</a>&nbsp;on Chromebook. That&rsquo;s amazing, right? Here, you can&nbsp;<strong>discover and search for a range of Linux apps and install them in just a click</strong>. All the apps will be installed from the Flatpak repository.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"How to Install Flatpak and Snap App Store in Linux on Chromebook [GUI] 2\" src=\"https://beebom.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/How-to-Install-Flatpak-and-Snap-App-Store-in-Linux-on-Chromebook-GUI-2.jpg\" style=\"height:431px; width:640px\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>5. While the GUI app store is great,&nbsp;<strong>sometimes it does not work properly</strong>. So here are the command line instructions to help you install Linux apps on your Chromebook through the Terminal. To find apps that you want to install, open&nbsp;<a href=\"https://flathub.org/home\" target=\"_blank\">Flathub</a>&nbsp;on your browser and discover the Linux apps.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"flathub\" src=\"https://beebom.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/How-to-Install-Flatpak-and-Snap-App-Store-in-Linux-on-Chromebook-GUI-4.jpg\" style=\"height:294px; width:640px\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>6. Now,&nbsp;<strong>open the app that you want to install and scroll down to the bottom.</strong>&nbsp;Here, you will find the command to install the app through the Terminal. Copy it and run the command on the Terminal to install the app. For example, here is how you can install&nbsp;<a href=\"https://beebom.com/spotify-tips-tricks/\">Spotify</a>&nbsp;through Flatpak.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em><strong>Note:</strong>&nbsp;Repeating again, run&nbsp;<code>sudo su</code>&nbsp;first to gain root access. Following that, execute the flatpak commands.</em></p>\r\n\r\n<pre>\r\nsudo flatpak install flathub com.spotify.Client</pre>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"GUI Linux app store\" src=\"https://beebom.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/How-to-Install-Flatpak-and-Snap-App-Store-in-Linux-on-Chromebook-GUI-5.jpg\" style=\"height:283px; width:640px\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>7. Once installed,<strong>&nbsp;you will find the program in your app drawer</strong>&nbsp;under the Linux folder. Alternatively, you can run it through the Terminal as well using the below command.</p>\r\n\r\n<pre>\r\nsudo flatpak run com.spotify.Client</pre>\r\n\r\n<p>8. Here are&nbsp;<strong>some crucial Flatpak commands</strong>&nbsp;that can help you while dealing with Linux apps on Chrome OS.</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Search for apps inside the Terminal:</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<pre>\r\nsudo flatpak search &lt;search_query&gt;</pre>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>List all Flatpak Installed Apps:</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<pre>\r\nsudo flatpak list</pre>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Uninstall an app installed through Flatpak:</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<pre>\r\n<code>sudo flatpak uninstall &lt;app_name&gt;</code></pre>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Update all apps:</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<pre>\r\nsudo flatpak update</pre>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>\r\n	<h2>Install Snap Store in Linux on Chromebook</h2>\r\n	</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>Snap Store is quite popular in the Linux community and many people choose it over other app packaging platforms because of its massive app repository. So here, I am going to show you how to install Snap Store in Linux on Chromebook. Having said that,&nbsp;<strong>during my testing, I was able to install the majority of apps but they didn&rsquo;t run quite well.</strong>&nbsp;Nevertheless, you can go ahead and try Snap Store on your Chromebook and see if it works for you.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>1. Open the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://beebom.com/essential-linux-commands/\">Linux Terminal</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<strong>execute the below commands one by one</strong>. It will install the Snap Store on your Chromebook.</p>\r\n\r\n<pre>\r\nsudo apt update\r\nsudo apt install snapd</pre>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"How to Install Flatpak and Snap App Store in Linux on Chromebook [GUI] 6\" src=\"https://beebom.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/How-to-Install-Flatpak-and-Snap-App-Store-in-Linux-on-Chromebook-GUI-6.jpg\" style=\"height:390px; width:640px\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>2.&nbsp;<strong>If at any stage, you get any error</strong>, run&nbsp;<code>sudo su</code>&nbsp;first and then proceed with other commands.</p>\r\n\r\n<pre>\r\nsudo su\r\nsudo apt update\r\nsudo apt install snapd</pre>\r\n\r\n<p>3. Now, to install any application,&nbsp;<strong>go to&nbsp;<a href=\"https://snapcraft.io/store\" target=\"_blank\">Snap Store</a>&nbsp;on the web and find your choice of application</strong>. Further, click on the install button at the top-right corner and you will get the command to install the app. Copy it and run the command in the Terminal. Within a few minutes, the application will be installed. For example, here is the command to install VLC.</p>\r\n\r\n<pre>\r\nsudo snap install vlc</pre>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"Install Snap Store in Linux on Chromebook\" src=\"https://beebom.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/How-to-Install-Flatpak-and-Snap-App-Store-in-Linux-on-Chromebook-GUI-7.jpg\" style=\"height:390px; width:640px\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>4. After the installation, use the below command to&nbsp;<strong>run the application</strong>.</p>\r\n\r\n<pre>\r\nsudo snap run vlc</pre>\r\n\r\n<p>5. If you want to&nbsp;<strong>search for Linux apps right in the Terminal</strong>&nbsp;then you can do so by the below command. After that, you can install the app by its normal name or package name through step #3.</p>\r\n\r\n<pre>\r\nsudo snap find &lt;search_query&gt;</pre>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"chromebook\" src=\"https://beebom.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/How-to-Install-Flatpak-and-Snap-App-Store-in-Linux-on-Chromebook-GUI-8.jpg\" style=\"height:390px; width:640px\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>6. Also, here are&nbsp;<strong>a few important Snap commands</strong>&nbsp;you will need while dealing with the Terminal.</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>List all Snap Installed Apps:</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<pre>\r\nsudo snap list</pre>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Uninstall an app installed through Snap:</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<pre>\r\n<code>sudo snap remove &lt;app_name&gt;</code></pre>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Update all apps:</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<pre>\r\nsudo snap refresh</pre>\r\n\r\n<p>7. You can also&nbsp;<strong>install the GUI version of the Snap Store</strong>&nbsp;by the below command. It will be much easier for you to discover and install Linux apps on Chromebook. However, in my testing, I was unable to install apps because of a sign-in error. Nevertheless, you can give it a try and see if it works on your Chromebook. After the installation, you will find Snap Store in the App Drawer under the Linux folder.</p>\r\n\r\n<pre>\r\nsudo apt-get install gnome-software-plugin-snap</pre>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"How to Install Flatpak and Snap App Store in Linux on Chromebook [GUI] 1\" src=\"https://beebom.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/How-to-Install-Flatpak-and-Snap-App-Store-in-Linux-on-Chromebook-GUI-1.jpg\" style=\"height:431px; width:640px\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Enjoy the GUI App Store in Linux on Chromebook</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>So that was our look into the two most popular app stores and how to install Flatpak and Snap App Store in Linux on Chromebook. While both the app stores are great and reliable, I think Flatpak works better on Chromebook. It installed the apps without any error and we were able to run them right from the App Drawer. So go ahead and install whichever app store you find interesting and reliable. Anyway, that is all from us. If you liked the article, do comment down below and let us know.

Microsoft brought the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://beebom.com/how-enable-linux-bash-shell-windows-10-wsl-2/\">Linux subsystem</a>&nbsp;on Windows 10 and now Google has introduced Linux on Chromebooks with full-fledged Terminal and Container support. While the Linux project on Chrome OS is still in beta, the results are quite promising. If you are an IT administrator or a software developer or studying computer programming, the addition of Linux on&nbsp;<a href=\"https://beebom.com/what-is-a-chromebook/\">Chromebook</a>&nbsp;can be a boon for you. So, let&rsquo;s go ahead and learn how to use Linux on a Chromebook right from the setup to package installation.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Use Linux on Your Chromebook in 2020</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Before beginning,&nbsp;<strong>make sure to check if your Chromebook supports Linux or not</strong>&nbsp;from this&nbsp;<a href=\"https://sites.google.com/a/chromium.org/dev/chromium-os/chrome-os-systems-supporting-linux\" target=\"_blank\">page</a>. To make it clear, if a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://beebom.com/best-chromebooks-you-can-buy/\">Chromebook has been launched in 2019</a>, it likely comes with Linux support. Apart from that, make sure to update your Chromebook to the latest version&ndash; preferably Chrome OS 79 to be able to use Linux on your Chromebook. Anyway, let&rsquo;s begin with the steps.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>1. First of all, open the Settings page by&nbsp;<strong>clicking on the cogwheel icon</strong>&nbsp;in the Quick Settings menu.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"Use Linux on Your Chromebook\" src=\"https://beebom.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/How-to-Use-Linux-on-Your-Chromebook-1.jpg\" style=\"height:560px; width:425px\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>2. Next,&nbsp;<strong>switch to the &ldquo;Linux (Beta)&rdquo; menu&nbsp;</strong>in the left pane and click on the &ldquo;Turn on&rdquo; button.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"Use Linux on Your Chromebook\" src=\"https://beebom.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/How-to-Use-Linux-on-Your-Chromebook-7.jpg\" style=\"height:264px; width:640px\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>3. A setup dialog will open up. Now, just&nbsp;<strong>click on the &ldquo;Install&rdquo; button</strong>&nbsp;and it will start downloading the necessary files to run Linux on your Chromebook.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://beebom.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/How-to-Use-Linux-on-Your-Chromebook-6.jpg\" style=\"height:525px; width:640px\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>4. After the installation is done, you can use the Linux Terminal just like any other app. Open the launcher and&nbsp;<strong>run the &ldquo;Terminal&rdquo; app</strong>. Voila, there you have it!</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"Use Linux on Your Chromebook\" src=\"https://beebom.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/How-to-Use-Linux-on-Your-Chromebook-2.jpg\" style=\"height:360px; width:640px\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>5. To test the Linux terminal, we installed the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://beebom.com/best-gimp-plugins/\">GIMP image editor</a>&nbsp;on our Chromebook and the installation went through without a hitch. However, the&nbsp;<strong>performance is not that great as GIMP is running in a Linux container</strong>. But we expect it to get better after the project exits the Beta program.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://beebom.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/How-to-Use-Linux-on-Your-Chromebook-3.jpg\" style=\"height:360px; width:640px\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>6. Apart from that, you must know that Chrome OS and Linux have different file systems. So to&nbsp;<strong>access the local folders and files on Linux</strong>, you will have to copy the files from Downloads and paste them into the Linux folder.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"Use Linux on Your Chromebook\" src=\"https://beebom.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/How-to-Use-Linux-on-Your-Chromebook-5.jpg\" style=\"height:400px; width:640px\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>7. However, if you&nbsp;<strong>don&rsquo;t want to make a duplicate copy</strong>&nbsp;then right-click on the folder that you want to share and click on &ldquo;Share with Linux&rdquo;. Now, it will show up in Linux&rsquo;s&nbsp;<code>mnt/chromeos/myfiles/downloads</code>&nbsp;directory.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"Use Linux on Your Chromebook\" src=\"https://beebom.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/How-to-Use-Linux-on-Your-Chromebook-4.jpg\" style=\"height:360px; width:640px\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>8.

The steps are quite easy and straightforward so you don&rsquo;t need to change your update channel or make any changes to&nbsp;<a href=\"https://beebom.com/google-chrome-flags/\">Chrome flags</a>.

Other benchmarks scores include 178.1FPS in Car Chase, 131FPS in Manhattan 3.1.1 1440p, 670FPS in T-Rex, 301 FPS in ALU 2, 281FPS in Driver Overhead 2 and more.

Since then, the iPhone-makers are reportedly giving voluntary employees traveling to the Asian country&nbsp;<strong>a hefty bonus to bear with the COVID-protection protocols in China</strong>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Previously, Apple employees traveling to China could take a 10-day business trip and return to the States. However, according to new protocols,&nbsp;<strong>any employee traveling to the country needs to stay for at least six weeks</strong>, as they would have to stay isolated for the first two.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>During these two isolation-weeks, the employees would be staying in a budget hotel chosen by the company. They will not get any restaurant delivery and will only have to eat stale Irish lamb stew made by the China Eastern Airlines staff. Moreover, with the lack of laundry service,&nbsp;<strong>the employees need to hand-wash their own clothes in their washrooms</strong>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So, as you can imagine, cooperating with these safety-protocols is pretty exhausting and depressing. And&nbsp;<strong>that is why Apple is giving a hefty bonus of $500 (~Rs. 37,315) a day</strong>&nbsp;to employees who are willing to go to China for work.</p>\r\n'),
