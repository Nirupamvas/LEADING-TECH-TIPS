Similarly, the recent mandatory lockdowns proved to be quite fruitful for the electrical engineer and product designer, Sam March who likes to build electrical gadgets from scratch in his leisure time. After&nbsp;<a href=\"https://imgur.com/gallery/FSBwD3g\" target=\"_blank\">making a smartwatch last year</a>, the guy made a GPS-enabled smart glass from scratch this time around.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A few months back, in the summers, March was walking down a scenic street with his smartphone giving him directions for his destination.

If you don&rsquo;t stop and look around once in a while, you could miss it.&rsquo; It was in that moment, I decided that I wanted to make some smart sunglasses that gave me turn-by-turn directions!&rdquo;</em>, wrote the&nbsp; engineer on Imgur.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Creativity at Its Peak</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>The homemade smart-glass comes with its own iOS app which March developed by himself. And whenever he needs to reach a location while enjoying the view,&nbsp;<strong>he just opens up the app, feeds the destination in it, and wears his smart glass</strong>. So, with the destination fed in the app, he does not even have to take out his phone from the pocket.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The GPS-enabled wearable communicates with the app and gives directions to reach the destination via different colored lights on either side of its frames. So, while wearing the glass,<strong>&nbsp;the user will be able to easily spot the light cue whenever a turn comes or he/she reaches the destination</strong>. The lights blink blue for turns and green when you reach the destination.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>You can check out the working of the smart wearable in the video below.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>March worked on this project for a pretty long time. He developed every component of the smart-wearable, from building the frames to designing the circuit boards.

', '<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>While&nbsp;<a href=\"https://beebom.com/siri-vs-google-assistant-vs-hound/\">Google Assistant is pretty powerful</a>&nbsp;and does a lot of things right, its in-app integration with third-party apps has been patchy at best. However, that seems to be changing now as Google has started tightening the screw and bringing deeply tied, in-app actions to Google Assistant. With the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://beebom.com/google-assistant-better-integration-android-apps/\">recent update</a>, you can now invoke in-app actions from third-party apps such as opening the Explore tab on Instagram, updating the profile picture on&nbsp;<a href=\"https://beebom.com/whatsapp-tricks-new-features/\">WhatsApp</a>, and more. So if want to browse and add third-party shortcuts to Google Assistant then follow along.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Add Third-party Shortcuts to Google Assistant</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>1. Open the Google app and move to the &ldquo;More&rdquo; menu at the bottom bar. Now, navigate to&nbsp;<strong>Settings -&gt; Google Assistant</strong>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"Use Third-party Shortcuts with Google Assistant\" src=\"https://beebom.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/1-4.jpg\" style=\"height:560px; width:506px\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>2. Now, tap on the &ldquo;<strong>Services</strong>&rdquo; tab and open &ldquo;Shortcuts&rdquo;.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"Use Third-party Shortcuts with Google Assistant\" src=\"https://beebom.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/3-Add-Third-party-Shortcuts-to-Google-Assistant.jpg\" style=\"height:560px; width:252px\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>3. Here, you will find all the third-party shortcuts that Google Assistant supports on your smartphone. Keep in mind, the shortcuts are populated based on the apps you have installed on your device. Now,&nbsp;<strong>tap on &ldquo;+&rdquo;</strong>&nbsp;to add your favorite shortcuts and you will get a confirmation from Google Assistant.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"Use Third-party Shortcuts with Google Assistant\" src=\"https://beebom.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/3-2.jpg\" style=\"height:560px; width:506px\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>4. You will find all your third-party shortcuts under the &ldquo;<strong>Your Shortcuts</strong>&rdquo; tab. For example, here I have added &ldquo;New Keep Notes&rdquo;, &ldquo;Twitter Messages&rdquo;, &ldquo;Explore Instagram&rdquo;, etc.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"Use Third-party Shortcuts with Google Assistant\" src=\"https://beebom.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/6-Add-Third-party-Shortcuts-to-Google-Assistant.jpg\" style=\"height:560px; width:252px\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>5. Now go ahead and say &ldquo;<strong>Hey Google, check news</strong>&rdquo; and it will directly take you to Twitter&rsquo;s search tab where you can find all sorts of news trending on Twitter. I also tried other variations like &ldquo;check Twitter news&rdquo; and it took me to the same page. Basically, you don&rsquo;t need to remember the correct phrase. Just say something closer to the original command and the Assistant will process it correctly.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://beebom.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/2-3.jpg\" style=\"height:560px; width:506px\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Run In-app Actions of Third-party Apps with Google Assistant</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>So that is how you can add and run third-party shortcuts with Google Assistant. To be honest, this sort of feature was already there on Google Assistant, but it was not deeply tied or required extensive support from Google.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For instance, recently, Google Assistant added support for&nbsp;<a href=\"https://beebom.com/google-assistant-whatsapp-video-voice-calls/\">WhatsApp calls</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://beebom.com/google-assistant-send-audio-messages-contacts/\">audio messages</a>. It&rsquo;s good to see Google housing all these third-party integrations in one place so users can browse and add their favorite shortcuts.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>That said, we would love to see Google allowing users to tinker with any in-app action and not just the predefined ones, similar to the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://beebom.com/manage-folders-shortcuts-app-ios-14/\">powerful Shortcuts app on iOS</a>. Perhaps, that may be coming in the future. Anyway, that is all from us. If you want to learn more such features then go through our article on the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://beebom.com/google-assistant-commands/\">best Google Assistant commands</a>.</p>\r\n', ''),

There are times when Apple takes inspiration from Android. Similarly, Google brings new&nbsp;<a href=\"https://beebom.com/improve-security-privacy-tips-ios-13/\">privacy features taking a cue from iOS</a>. At this point, both the ecosystems are quite polished and have matured by leaps and bounds, especially Android. However, there is one aspect that makes iOS stand out and that is privacy controls. Every year, Apple adds new privacy controls to iOS which makes Android users wanting for more. So in this article, we bring you a handy guide on how to get iOS 14 features on Android including privacy and other useful features. So without further ado, let&rsquo;s get started.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Get the Best iOS 14 Features on Android</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Here are the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://beebom.com/best-ios-14-hidden-features/\">best iOS 14 features</a>&nbsp;that you can get on Android right now. You can go through the list below and click on the link to move to the corresponding feature. We have mostly included iOS 14 features that are natively not available on Android devices.</p>\r\n\r\n<ol>\r\n	<li><a href=\"https://beebom.com/get-ios-14-features-on-android/#ind\">Camera and Mic Indicator</a></li>\r\n	<li><a href=\"https://beebom.com/get-ios-14-features-on-android/#lib\">App Library</a></li>\r\n	<li><a href=\"https://beebom.com/get-ios-14-features-on-android/#fil\">SMS Filtering</a></li>\r\n	<li><a href=\"https://beebom.com/get-ios-14-features-on-android/#back\">Back Tap</a></li>\r\n	<li><a href=\"https://beebom.com/get-ios-14-features-on-android/#store\">Privacy information on the App Store</a></li>\r\n	<li><a href=\"https://beebom.com/get-ios-14-features-on-android/#temp\">Temporary Permission</a></li>\r\n	<li><a href=\"https://beebom.com/get-ios-14-features-on-android/#inapp\">In-App Search</a></li>\r\n	<li><a href=\"https://beebom.com/get-ios-14-features-on-android/#assign\">Assign Reminders</a></li>\r\n	<li><a href=\"https://beebom.com/get-ios-14-features-on-android/#report\">Website Privacy Report</a></li>\r\n	<li><a href=\"https://beebom.com/get-ios-14-features-on-android/#conv\">Conversation Mode</a></li>\r\n	<li><a href=\"https://beebom.com/get-ios-14-features-on-android/#clip\">Bonus: Block Clipboard Access</a></li>\r\n</ol>\r\n\r\n<h2>List of iOS 14 Features on Android</h2>\r\n\r\n<h3>1. Camera and Mic Indicator</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>During the release of iOS 14, Apple made some big announcements regarding privacy and one feature that stood out was camera and mic indicator. On iOS 14, whenever an app uses the camera or mic,&nbsp;<strong>a dot indicator appears</strong>&nbsp;at the top of the screen. This is done to alert the user that an app is snooping on you. Further, you can find the app name in the Control Center and uninstall it right away.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"1. Camera and Mic Indicator iOS 14 Features on Android\" src=\"https://beebom.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/a-11.jpg\" style=\"height:416px; width:640px\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>So if you want this iOS 14 feature on Android,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://beebom.com/access-dots-brings-ios-14-cam-mic-indicator-dots-android/\">you can&nbsp;<strong>use Access Dots</strong></a>&nbsp;(<a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=you.in.spark.access.dots\" target=\"_blank\">Free</a>, offers in-app purchases). The app allows you to get a similar indicator as iOS 14 for mic and camera usage. The best part is that you can even customize the colors and change the size and position of the dot. So go ahead and get this awesome iOS 14 feature on Android by using the Access Dots app.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>2. App Library Folders</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>After years of pestering, Apple finally caved in and brought an app drawer on iOS 14. Similar to Android launchers, now a separate pane houses all the apps on iOS 14. But that is not all about the new app drawer. There is something called App Library which&nbsp;<strong>automatically organizes all of your apps</strong>&nbsp;into a folder depending on the app category.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"2. App Library\" src=\"https://beebom.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/b-7.jpg\" style=\"height:529px; width:640px\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>To get the App Library feature on Android, you just need to download a third-party launcher such as Microsoft Launcher (<a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.microsoft.launcher&amp;hl=en_US\" target=\"_blank\">Free</a>) or&nbsp;<strong>Lawnchair</strong>&nbsp;(<a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=ch.deletescape.lawnchair.plah&amp;hl=en_US\" target=\"_blank\">Free</a>) or Nova (<a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.teslacoilsw.launcher&amp;hl=en_US\" target=\"_blank\">Free</a>, $4.99). All these launchers allow you to create app folders right into the app drawer. However, keep in mind, these launchers don&rsquo;t sort the app automatically so you will have to do it on your own. If you want automatic categorization then you can use Poco Launcher (<a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.mi.android.globallauncher&amp;hl=en_US\" target=\"_blank\">Free</a>), but instead of app folders, it offers you separate windows.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>3. SMS Filtering</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>With the announcement of iOS 14, Apple added a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://beebom.com/ios-14-messages-app-update-improvement/\">big feature to its messaging app</a>. Now, spammy texts, OTPs, and&nbsp;<strong>promotional messages will be filtered out</strong>&nbsp;and put in separate folders. This completely changes the messaging experience, especially in India where you get so many junk texts every day.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"3. SMS Filtering iOS 14 Features on Android\" src=\"https://beebom.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/1-17.jpg\" style=\"height:560px; width:506px\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>On Android, SMS filtering is not available natively, but you can install a third-party messaging app that filters texts automatically. You can&nbsp;<strong>install SMS Organizer</strong>&nbsp;(<a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.microsoft.android.smsorganizer&amp;hl=en_US\" target=\"_blank\">Free</a>) by Microsoft to get iOS 14&rsquo;s SMS filtering feature on Android. It&rsquo;s one of my favorite apps on Android and you must give it a try.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>4. Back Tap</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>To make iPhones more accessible and easier to use, iOS 14 brings something called Back Tap that allows you to&nbsp;<strong>invoke an action by double-tapping on the back</strong>&nbsp;of the phone. You can just double-tap on the back and take a screenshot or&nbsp;<a href=\"https://beebom.com/google-assistant-commands/\">ask Google Assistant</a>&nbsp;some questions. That&rsquo;s quite cool, right?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>To get this iOS 14 feature on Android, you might have to wait a bit longer. Google is developing a similar feature for Pixel phones which might get released with Android 11. However if you want it right now,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.xda-developers.com/tap-tap-brings-ios-14-android-11-back-tap-gesture-any-android-device/\" target=\"_blank\">Quinny899 from XDA</a>&nbsp;has come to the rescue. He has&nbsp;<a href=\"https://beebom.com/tap-tap-app-brings-back-tap-gestures-to-your-android-phone/\">developed an&nbsp;<strong>app called &ldquo;Tap, Tap&rdquo;</strong></a>&nbsp;that allows you to double-tap on the rear and invoke actions of your choice.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"4. Back Tap\" src=\"https://beebom.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/2-15.jpg\" style=\"height:560px; width:506px\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>If you are wondering how it works, well, the app is using gyroscope and accelerometer readings and comparing it with&nbsp;<strong>machine learning models</strong>&nbsp;that Google has trained for Pixel devices. It works surprisingly well on my OnePlus 7T and if you want iOS 14&rsquo;s Back Tap feature on Android then Tap, Tap is here for you. You can download the app from&nbsp;<a href=\"https://forum.xda-developers.com/android/apps-games/app-tap-tap-double-tap-device-gesture-t4140573\" target=\"_blank\">here</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>5. Privacy information on the App Store</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>To make people aware of privacy malpractices, on iOS 14, Apple will be displaying privacy information of each app on the App Store in easily understandable language. For example, before you download an app, you can find out&nbsp;<strong>what data the app can use to track you</strong>&nbsp;and what data the app will have access to. This goes a long way in understanding what sort of privacy policy does the app practice so that you can either choose to install an app or discard it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"5. Privacy information on the App Store iOS 14 Features on Android\" src=\"https://beebom.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/3-12.jpg\" style=\"height:560px; width:506px\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>While Android does not have this feature natively, you can&nbsp;<strong>install an app called Exodus</strong>&nbsp;(<a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.eu.exodus_privacy.exodusprivacy&amp;hl=en_US\" target=\"_blank\">Free</a>). It scans all your installed apps and displays all the trackers that the app is using to track you. Apart from that, you can also find out all kinds of permissions that app has been granted by default. This will allow you to understand how much data the app is seeking from you. So go ahead and get this iOS 14 feature on Android to strengthen your privacy.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>6. Temporary Permission</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Apple brought &ldquo;Allow once&rdquo; permission dialog last year with iOS 13 and now we are hearing that Android 11 will sport this feature. On top of that, Android users might also get&nbsp;<strong>auto-revoke permission</strong>&nbsp;feature. The way it works is, if you have not used an app for some time, sensitive permissions will be automatically revoked.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"6. Temporary Permission\" src=\"https://beebom.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/4-8.jpg\" style=\"height:560px; width:506px\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>However, not everyone is going to receive the Android 11 update so if you want this excellent privacy feature on your Android right now, you can&nbsp;<strong>install Bouncer</strong>&nbsp;(<a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.samruston.permission&amp;hl=en_US\" target=\"_blank\">$1.99</a>). It allows you to grant temporary permission to an app and the moment you exit from the app, the permission is automatically revoked. That&rsquo;s really great, right? So go ahead and get this iOS feature on Android right away.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>7. In-App Search</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>With iOS 14, Apple has overhauled how the search works. You can now perform in-app searches which basically means that you can&nbsp;<strong>search for your library or songs</strong>&nbsp;in Apple Music right from the search bar. No need to open the app and look for the content.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"7. In-App Search iOS 14 Features on Android\" src=\"https://beebom.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/5-2.jpg\" style=\"height:560px; width:506px\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>If you want this iOS 14 feature on Android then you can&nbsp;<strong>install Sesame</strong>&nbsp;(<a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=ninja.sesame.app.edge&amp;hl=en_US\" target=\"_blank\">Free</a>, offers in-app purchases). The app is one tap away from searching for your music, contacts, system settings,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://beebom.com/how-to-create-instagram-stories-on-android-and-iphone/\">Instagram stories</a>, favorite apps, and more. Simply put, you will have access to everything in just one tap.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>8. Assign Reminders</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>With iOS 14, you can&nbsp;<strong>assign reminders to people</strong>&nbsp;you share lists with. And they will be reminded according to the schedule. This feature is amazing and can help you split tasks and accomplish them without any fail. You can also get this iOS 14 feature on Android by just using the Google Assistant.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"8. Assign Reminders\" src=\"https://beebom.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/c-3.jpg\" style=\"height:560px; width:252px\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>If you are part of a family group then you just need to say &ldquo;<strong>Hey Google remind X to&hellip;</strong>&rdquo; and the reminder will be assigned to the said person. You can find your family group from the Google App -&gt; 3-dot menu -&gt; Settings -&gt; Google Assistant -&gt; Your People. And to customize assignable reminders, move to the &ldquo;Services&rdquo; tab under Google Assistant and open &ldquo;Assignable Reminders&rdquo;.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>9. Website Privacy Report</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>During the announcement of iOS 14, Apple discussed many new features of Safari and how it has been finetuned for a more privacy-friendly experience. Among the many features of Safari, I liked the Website Privacy Report. Basically, you will be able to&nbsp;<strong>see what trackers and cookies the website is using</strong>&nbsp;and the cross-site trackers that Safari has blocked.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"iOS 14 Features on Android\" src=\"https://beebom.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/9.jpg\" style=\"height:560px; width:506px\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>On Android, Chrome does not offer such a report which is disappointing (learn how to&nbsp;<a href=\"https://beebom.com/how-to-get-safari-privacy-features-chrome/\">get Safari features on Chrome</a>). Anyway, if you move to&nbsp;<strong>DuckDuckGo</strong>&nbsp;(<a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.duckduckgo.mobile.android&amp;hl=en_US\" target=\"_blank\">Free</a>) or Firefox (<a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.mozilla.firefox&amp;hl=en_US\" target=\"_blank\">Free</a>) or Brave (<a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.brave.browser&amp;hl=en_US\" target=\"_blank\">Free</a>) on Android then it shows you all the cookies and trackers that the browser has blocked. DuckDuckGo even gives a privacy rating to the websites you visit. In tandem, if you want iOS 14&rsquo;s Website Privacy Report on Android then the DuckDuckGo browser would be a great choice.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>10. Conversation Mode</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>With the iOS 14 release, Apple announced a new Translate app that looks really promising. It&nbsp;<strong>has offline capabilities</strong>&nbsp;and language detection is on point. What caught my attention was Conversation Mode which allows you to say something, and the Translate app transcribes the voice on the screen, followed by the translated audio. It works really well.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\" iOS 14 Features on Android 10. Conversation Mode\" src=\"https://beebom.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/d-1.jpg\" style=\"height:560px; width:252px\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>If you want something like Conversation Mode on Android then Google Assistant will be of your great help. Google Assistant comes with a dedicated Interpreter Mode which works very similar to iOS 14&rsquo;s Conversation Mode.&nbsp;<strong>Just say &ldquo;interpreter mode&rdquo;</strong>&nbsp;to Google Assistant and you will have your voice transcribed on the screen with translated audio. As an aside, you can learn more about&nbsp;<a href=\"https://beebom.com/apple-translate-vs-google-translate/\">Apple Translate vs Google Translate</a>&nbsp;from our in-depth article.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Bonus: Block Clipboard Access</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>iOS 14 has made many internal revisions to protect your privacy. For example, now you get a notification on iOS 14 whenever an app&nbsp;<strong>tries to access the clipboard</strong>. You can have anything &mdash; password, sensitive information, banking details &mdash; copied to your clipboard, and apps getting easy access to it is not right.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Android 10 has already restrictions in place as to what apps can access the clipboard and what cannot. However, if you are&nbsp;<strong>running an older version of Android</strong>&nbsp;then you can find out apps with clipboard access and you can even block them from reading your clipboard again. Here are the steps to follow.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>1.&nbsp;<a href=\"https://beebom.com/how-to-install-adb-windows-mac/\">Set up ADB</a>&nbsp;and move to&nbsp;<code>adb shell</code>. Now, execute the below command to&nbsp;<strong>find all the apps</strong>&nbsp;with clipboard access.</p>\r\n\r\n<pre>\r\ncmd appops query-op --user 0 READ_CLIPBOARD allow</pre>\r\n\r\n<p>2. Note down the package name of the app that you want to block and&nbsp;<strong>execute the below command</strong>. This will block the app from reading the clipboard again. If you want to enable it then just replace&nbsp;<code>ignore</code>&nbsp;with&nbsp;<code>allow</code>.</p>\r\n\r\n<pre>\r\ncmd appops set &lt;packagename&gt; READ_CLIPBOARD ignore</pre>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://beebom.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/abc-2.jpg\" style=\"height:238px; width:641px\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Get iOS 14 Features on Android Right Now</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>So that is how you can get iOS 14 features on Android without much tweaking or rooting your device. It&rsquo;s no secret that every year Apple brings new features to iOS and sets the bar high for Android and the rest of software makers. I love the fact that Apple pushes hard for protecting user privacy and that revitalizes Google to do more when it comes to the privacy front. Anyway, that is all from us.

If you are yet to use new Markup color tools in iOS 14 on iPhone and iPad, follow along to get started!</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Use New Markup Color Tools on iOS 14 and iPadOS 14</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Whether you want to&nbsp;<a href=\"https://beebom.com/evernote-alternatives/\">create a good-looking note</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://beebom.com/best-photo-editing-apps-iphone/\">edit your photos</a>, add some nice customization to screenshots, or even insert a digital signature to a PDF document, the Markup tool has a role to play. With the inclusion of several precision tools, it now offers you more flexibility to create attractive designs or&nbsp;<a href=\"https://beebom.com/best-pdf-editor/\">annotate PDFs</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>1. To get going, access the&nbsp;<strong>Markup icon</strong>&nbsp;from apps like Photos, Safari, and Notes. You can also access it from a screenshot and Share Sheet as well.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"Accessing markup tools in safari, screenshot, and notes\" src=\"https://beebom.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Accessing-markup-tools-in-safari-screenshot-and-notes.jpg\" style=\"height:560px; width:781px\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>2. I&rsquo;m going to bring it up from the&nbsp;<strong>Notes app</strong>. Simply open a note and then tap on the&nbsp;<strong>Markup icon</strong>&nbsp;at the bottom.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"Tap on the Markup button\" src=\"https://beebom.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Tap-on-the-Markup-button.jpg\" style=\"height:560px; width:259px\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>3. Next, tap on the&nbsp;<strong>color button</strong>&nbsp;at the bottom right corner of the screen to reveal all the new color tools.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"Tap on the color button at the bottom right corner of the screen\" src=\"https://beebom.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Tap-on-the-color-button-at-the-bottom-right-corner-of-the-screen.jpg\" style=\"height:560px; width:259px\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>4. You should see three tabs along the top:&nbsp;<strong>Grid, Spectrum, and Sliders.</strong>&nbsp;The Opacity slider is located along the bottom. Interestingly, there is also an option to&nbsp;<strong>save custom colors</strong>. To do it, tap on the&nbsp;<strong>&ldquo;+&rdquo; button&nbsp;</strong>at the bottom.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"Using new Markup tools in iOS 14\" src=\"https://beebom.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Using-new-Markup-tools-in-iOS-14.jpeg\" style=\"height:560px; width:259px\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>One of my favorite additions to the Markup tools is the super handy&nbsp;<strong>&ldquo;eyedropper&rdquo; tool</strong>&nbsp;located at the upper-left corner of the screen. What makes this tool so user-friendly is the ability to pick a color from any source on the screen.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"tap on eyedropper tool\" src=\"https://beebom.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/tap-on-eyedropper-tool.jpeg\" style=\"height:560px; width:259px\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Another notable feature is the option to&nbsp;<strong>select colors by hexadecimal values</strong>&nbsp;or using the dial option in each RGB value with the help of sliders or getting it done numerically.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>5. In the end, make sure to tap on&nbsp;<strong>Done</strong>&nbsp;at the top right corner of the screen to finish.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"Make sure to tap on Done at the top right corner to finish\" src=\"https://beebom.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Make-sure-to-tap-on-Done-at-the-top-right-corner-to-finish.jpeg\" style=\"height:560px; width:259px\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>6.

Thanks to the addition of some notable tools like eyedropper and hexadecimal support, Markup seems to be a complete package now.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>What&rsquo;s your take on the new Markup color tools?

The feature was long due and users tied to the Google ecosystem were sorely missing the feature.', '<p>After&nbsp;<a href=\"https://beebom.com/google-meet-add-custom-background-raise-hand-other-new-features-soon/\">announcing</a>&nbsp;that custom background is coming to Google Meet earlier in June, finally, Google has&nbsp;<a href=\"https://beebom.com/google-meet-now-supports-custom-backgrounds-on-the-web/\">added support</a>&nbsp;for virtual backgrounds before the end of the year. The feature was long due and users tied to the Google ecosystem were sorely missing the feature. As we noted in our&nbsp;<a href=\"https://beebom.com/google-meet-vs-zoom-vs-microsoft-teams/\">Google Meet vs Zoom</a>&nbsp;comparison, Google Meet is way behind Zoom in terms of feature set. Thankfully, the gap is slowly closing. The custom background feature is available to both free and paid users. So if you are interested, follow our guide and learn how to use custom backgrounds on Google Meet.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Use Custom Backgrounds on Google Meet</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Before moving to steps, note that custom background on Google Meet is&nbsp;<strong>currently available only on the web</strong>. Google has stated that the feature will come to Android and iOS apps in the future. Apart from that, keep in mind, the custom backgrounds feature is not available to organizations that have opted for G Suite for Education plan. With that out of the way, let&rsquo; go through the instructions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>1. The process to use custom backgrounds on Google Meet is pretty straightforward. While you are on a video call, just click on the 3-dot menu on the bottom-right corner and select &ldquo;<strong>Change Background</strong>&ldquo;.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"use custom backgrounds on google meet\" src=\"https://beebom.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/1-use-custom-backgrounds-on-google-meet.jpg\" style=\"height:560px; width:362px\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>2. From here, you can choose any virtual background of your choice. You have the option to blur the background along with&nbsp;<strong>a variety of preloaded images</strong>&nbsp;ranging from cafes to libraries, beaches, and more.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"use custom backgrounds on google meet\" src=\"https://beebom.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/2-use-custom-backgrounds-on-google-meet.jpg\" style=\"height:360px; width:640px\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>3. If you want to upload your own custom background on Google Meet then simply&nbsp;<strong>click on the &ldquo;+&rdquo; button</strong>&nbsp;and select an image from your computer. That&rsquo;s it. Keep in mind, as of now, it does not support dynamic videos as custom backgrounds. Also, the image must be in JPG format and must not exceed the size limit of 16MB.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://beebom.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/3-use-custom-backgrounds-on-google-meet.jpg\" style=\"height:560px; width:398px\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Apply Custom Backgrounds on Google Meet</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>So that is how you can apply custom backgrounds on Google Meet. In my experience, the face detection and background separation on Google Meet was not as good as Zoom. That said, the blur background worked pretty well without any face trimming issues. Anyway, that is all from us. In case, you want to learn&nbsp;<a href=\"https://beebom.com/how-upload-change-background-microsoft-teams/\">how to change backgrounds on Microsoft Teams</a>&nbsp;then follow our linked guide.</p>\r\n', '1.jpg'),

But what if I tell you that Microsoft has added a new Task Manager solely for managing background tasks while playing games on the PC? Yes, you read that right. Now, you can monitor tasks on Windows 10 while playing games and you don&rsquo;t need to leave your gaming window. Right on the gaming screen, you can monitor and even&nbsp;<a href=\"https://beebom.com/speed-up-windows-10-2/\">close resource-hogging tasks</a>&nbsp;that are hindering your gameplay. So if you want to pin a simple task manager on the gaming screen then follow this guide.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Monitor Tasks on Windows 10 While Playing Games</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Before we begin, make sure you are updated to the latest&nbsp;<strong>Windows 10 October 2020</strong>&nbsp;build. The feature that we are going to discuss here was added to the Xbox Game Bar through the Windows 10 20H2 update.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>1. First and foremost, press the&nbsp;<strong>Win + G</strong>&nbsp;<a href=\"https://beebom.com/windows-10-keyboard-shortcuts/\">keyboard shortcut on Windows 10</a>&nbsp;to open the Xbox Game Bar.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"Monitor Tasks on Windows 10 While Playing Games\" src=\"https://beebom.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Screenshot-54.jpg\" style=\"height:205px; width:640px\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>2. Here, click on the &ldquo;<strong>Widget Menu</strong>&rdquo; and select &ldquo;Resources&rdquo;.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"Monitor Tasks on Windows 10 While Playing Games\" src=\"https://beebom.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Screenshot-55.jpg\" style=\"height:560px; width:538px\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>3. Now, a&nbsp;<strong>Resources window will appear</strong>&nbsp;on your screen. In the first run, it might take some time to show all the tasks.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"Monitor Tasks on Windows 10 While Playing Games\" src=\"https://beebom.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Screenshot-56.jpg\" style=\"height:347px; width:536px\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>4. Here, you can monitor all the tasks on Windows 10. In case, while playing a game, the impact goes high for certain tasks then you can simply&nbsp;<strong>click on the &ldquo;X&rdquo; button</strong>&nbsp;to close the said task. You can also click on &ldquo;Show More&rdquo; to see more details.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://beebom.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Screenshot-57.jpg\" style=\"height:382px; width:640px\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>5. The best part about this feature is that it allows you to&nbsp;<strong>pin the widget on the screen</strong>. Basically, while playing games, you will not have to press&nbsp;<a href=\"https://beebom.com/how-to-customize-the-alttab-behavior-on-windows-10/\">Alt + Tab</a>&nbsp;to check background processes. Simply click on the &ldquo;Pin&rdquo; icon and it will sit on your screen giving you access to background tasks while playing games.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://beebom.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Screenshot-58.jpg\" style=\"height:226px; width:309px\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Pin Task Manager While Playing Games on PC</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>So that is how you can monitor tasks on Windows 10 while playing games. I love the fact that Microsoft is continuously adding new widgets and improving Xbox Game Bar on PC. Since it&rsquo;s a first-party solution, it helps in improving performance while playing games.

Microsoft brought the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://beebom.com/how-enable-linux-bash-shell-windows-10-wsl-2/\">Linux subsystem</a>&nbsp;on Windows 10 and now Google has introduced Linux on Chromebooks with full-fledged Terminal and Container support. While the Linux project on Chrome OS is still in beta, the results are quite promising. If you are an IT administrator or a software developer or studying computer programming, the addition of Linux on&nbsp;<a href=\"https://beebom.com/what-is-a-chromebook/\">Chromebook</a>&nbsp;can be a boon for you. So, let&rsquo;s go ahead and learn how to use Linux on a Chromebook right from the setup to package installation.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Use Linux on Your Chromebook in 2020</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Before beginning,&nbsp;<strong>make sure to check if your Chromebook supports Linux or not</strong>&nbsp;from this&nbsp;<a href=\"https://sites.google.com/a/chromium.org/dev/chromium-os/chrome-os-systems-supporting-linux\" target=\"_blank\">page</a>. To make it clear, if a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://beebom.com/best-chromebooks-you-can-buy/\">Chromebook has been launched in 2019</a>, it likely comes with Linux support. Apart from that, make sure to update your Chromebook to the latest version&ndash; preferably Chrome OS 79 to be able to use Linux on your Chromebook. Anyway, let&rsquo;s begin with the steps.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>1. First of all, open the Settings page by&nbsp;<strong>clicking on the cogwheel icon</strong>&nbsp;in the Quick Settings menu.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"Use Linux on Your Chromebook\" src=\"https://beebom.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/How-to-Use-Linux-on-Your-Chromebook-1.jpg\" style=\"height:560px; width:425px\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>2. Next,&nbsp;<strong>switch to the &ldquo;Linux (Beta)&rdquo; menu&nbsp;</strong>in the left pane and click on the &ldquo;Turn on&rdquo; button.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"Use Linux on Your Chromebook\" src=\"https://beebom.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/How-to-Use-Linux-on-Your-Chromebook-7.jpg\" style=\"height:264px; width:640px\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>3. A setup dialog will open up. Now, just&nbsp;<strong>click on the &ldquo;Install&rdquo; button</strong>&nbsp;and it will start downloading the necessary files to run Linux on your Chromebook.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://beebom.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/How-to-Use-Linux-on-Your-Chromebook-6.jpg\" style=\"height:525px; width:640px\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>4. After the installation is done, you can use the Linux Terminal just like any other app. Open the launcher and&nbsp;<strong>run the &ldquo;Terminal&rdquo; app</strong>. Voila, there you have it!</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"Use Linux on Your Chromebook\" src=\"https://beebom.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/How-to-Use-Linux-on-Your-Chromebook-2.jpg\" style=\"height:360px; width:640px\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>5. To test the Linux terminal, we installed the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://beebom.com/best-gimp-plugins/\">GIMP image editor</a>&nbsp;on our Chromebook and the installation went through without a hitch. However, the&nbsp;<strong>performance is not that great as GIMP is running in a Linux container</strong>. But we expect it to get better after the project exits the Beta program.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://beebom.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/How-to-Use-Linux-on-Your-Chromebook-3.jpg\" style=\"height:360px; width:640px\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>6. Apart from that, you must know that Chrome OS and Linux have different file systems. So to&nbsp;<strong>access the local folders and files on Linux</strong>, you will have to copy the files from Downloads and paste them into the Linux folder.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"Use Linux on Your Chromebook\" src=\"https://beebom.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/How-to-Use-Linux-on-Your-Chromebook-5.jpg\" style=\"height:400px; width:640px\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>7. However, if you&nbsp;<strong>don&rsquo;t want to make a duplicate copy</strong>&nbsp;then right-click on the folder that you want to share and click on &ldquo;Share with Linux&rdquo;. Now, it will show up in Linux&rsquo;s&nbsp;<code>mnt/chromeos/myfiles/downloads</code>&nbsp;directory.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"Use Linux on Your Chromebook\" src=\"https://beebom.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/How-to-Use-Linux-on-Your-Chromebook-4.jpg\" style=\"height:360px; width:640px\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>8. In case you want to&nbsp;<strong>learn more about Linux</strong>&nbsp;and how to use it on a Chromebook, we have already covered a list of&nbsp;<a href=\"https://beebom.com/essential-linux-commands/\">handy Linux commands</a>&nbsp;in a separate article. Apart from that, you can also check out our article on the<a href=\"https://beebom.com/best-linux-apps/\">&nbsp;best Linux apps</a>&nbsp;and the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://beebom.com/free-online-resources-learning-linux/\">best online resources</a>&nbsp;to learn this powerful operating system.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Enable Linux on Your Chromebook and Open The Door of Endless Possibilities</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>So that was our short article on how to use Linux on a Chromebook. The steps are quite easy and straightforward so you don&rsquo;t need to change your update channel or make any changes to&nbsp;<a href=\"https://beebom.com/google-chrome-flags/\">Chrome flags</a>.

Especially as far as the security and privacy of players in India is concerned, the company says that it&nbsp;<em>&ldquo;will conduct regular audits and verifications on the storage systems holding Indian users&rsquo; personally identifiable information to reinforce security and ensure that their data is safely managed.&rdquo;</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>There are also going to be some in-game changes. The game will now have green hit markers, and will be set in a virtual simulation training ground, according to the release. I&rsquo;m not entirely sure exactly how much this game will differ from the PUBG Mobile we know, but hopefully it won&rsquo;t change a lot. The company hasn&rsquo;t announced a release date yet, but hopefully we&rsquo;ll get to learn more about it soon.</p>\r\n', ''),

All these methods are tried and tested, and you will not face any issues related to booting your PC. So without any delay, let&rsquo;s go ahead and check out the five ways to delete Temp files in Windows 11.</p>\n\n<h2>Delete Temp Files in Windows 11 (2022)</h2>\n\n<p>We have included five different ways to delete Temp files in Windows 11 in this guide. All the methods are completely safe to use, and you will not face any boot issues by deleting temporary files and folders. We also recommend going through all the sections to have thorough knowledge about cleaning junk files from your PC.</p>\n\n<p>Table of Contents&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h3>What are Temp Files in Windows 11?</h3>\n\n<p>Temp files or temporary files in Windows 11 are essentially&nbsp;<strong>data stored by apps and the operating system</strong>&nbsp;to provide you with a seamless experience. For example, when you download a file using IDM &mdash; a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://beebom.com/best-download-managers-for-windows/\">popular download manager for Windows</a>, it stores the file chunks in the Windows Temp folder. And when the download is complete, these file chunks are collated and moved to the Downloads folders.</p>\n\n<p>Similarly, when you have not saved a Word or TXT document, those files are temporarily saved in the Temp folder. The Temp folder is located at&nbsp;<code>C:UsersYourUserNameAppDataLocalTemp</code>.</p>\n\n<p><img alt=\"What are Temp Files in Windows 11?\" src=\"https://beebom.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/93.jpg?w=640\" style=\"height:462px; width:640px\" /></p>\n\n<p>In essence, Temp files are not bad per se for the smooth functioning of your system. It includes logs, system cache, and other disposable items. Here&rsquo;s a brief list of the type of temporary files you will find in the Temp folder on your Windows 11 PC:</p>\n\n<ul>\n	<li><em>Windows Update Cleanup</em></li>\n	<li><em>Upgrade Log Files</em></li>\n	<li><em>Windows ESD Installation Files</em></li>\n	<li><em>Temporary Files</em></li>\n	<li><em>Temporary Internet Files</em></li>\n	<li><em>Device Driver Packages</em></li>\n	<li><em>Thumbnails</em></li>\n	<li><em>Downloads</em></li>\n	<li><em>Microsoft Defender Antivirus</em></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>However, after prolonged usage of the PC, temporary files start gathering in huge numbers and data size. A third-party app you no longer use<strong>&nbsp;may have kept GBs of data</strong>&nbsp;in the Temp folder. Or, a program might not be cleaning up the Windows Temp folder after the job is done. In such cases, it becomes important to remove the Temp files from Windows 11. And in this tutorial, we will show you exactly how to do that.</p>\n\n<h3>Best Ways to Delete Temp Files in Windows 11</h3>\n\n<p>Method 1: Delete Temp Files From Windows 11 Settings Page</p>\n\n<p>First, let&rsquo;s look at the easiest method to delete temporary files in Windows 11. You can simply select the different temp files listed above in Windows 11 settings and delete them as per your convenience. Here&rsquo;s how it works:</p>\n\n<p>1. Press the Windows key and search for &ldquo;storage&rdquo;. Now, open &ldquo;<strong>Storage settings</strong>&rdquo; from the search results.</p>\n\n<p><img alt=\"Delete Temp Files From Windows 11 Settings Page\" src=\"https://beebom.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/95.jpg?w=553\" style=\"height:560px; width:553px\" /></p>\n\n<p>2. Here, you will find a section called &ldquo;<strong>Temporary files</strong>&rdquo; under the storage breakdown. Click to open it.</p>\n\n<p><img alt=\"temporary files Windows 11 Settings Page\" src=\"https://beebom.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/96.jpg?w=640\" style=\"height:444px; width:640px\" /></p>\n\n<p>3. Your Windows 11 PC will now scan for all the temporary files and display the removable files. We suggest you keep everything checked&nbsp;<strong>except for &ldquo;Downloads</strong>&ldquo;. In case you don&rsquo;t wish to&nbsp;<a href=\"https://beebom.com/how-roll-back-to-windows-10-from-windows-11/\">roll back to Windows 10 from Windows 11</a>, you can also check the &ldquo;Windows Update Cleanup&rdquo; and &ldquo;Previous Windows Installation&rdquo; options. This will remove a significant amount of temporary update files.</p>\n\n<p><img alt=\"temporary Windows 11 Settings Page\" src=\"https://beebom.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/97.jpg?w=640\" style=\"height:444px; width:640px\" /></p>\n\n<p>4. Finally, click on &ldquo;<strong>Remove files</strong>&ldquo;, and you are done. Almost all the temporary files will be removed from your Windows 11 PC with this process.</p>\n\n<p><img alt=\"Delete Temp Files From Windows 11 Settings Page\" src=\"https://beebom.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/97-Copy.jpg?w=640\" style=\"height:444px; width:640px\" /></p>\n\n<p>Method 2: Use Disk Cleanup in Windows 11</p>\n\n<p>While Windows 11 has integrated most of the Disk Cleanup options into Windows Settings, in case you are old school and want to remove all the temporary files from Control Panel, here is how to do it.</p>\n\n<p>1. Press &ldquo;Windows + R&rdquo; to open the Run prompt. Next, type&nbsp;<code><strong>cleanmgr</strong></code>&nbsp;and hit Enter or click OK.</p>\n\n<p><img alt=\"Disk Cleanup in Windows 11 cleanmgr\" src=\"https://beebom.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/explorer_FRmY897cpV.jpg\" /></p>\n\n<p>2. After that,<strong>&nbsp;select the &ldquo;C:&rdquo; drive</strong>&nbsp;and click &ldquo;OK&rdquo;.</p>\n\n<p><img alt=\"Disk Cleanup in Windows 11\" src=\"https://beebom.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/cleanmgr_Xd5KMdmhq9.jpg\" /></p>\n\n<p>3. In the next window, click on &ldquo;<strong>Clean up system files</strong>&ldquo;. It will scan for all the temporary files. You may have to select the C drive again in the next prompt.</p>\n\n<p><img alt=\"Disk Cleanup in Windows 11\" src=\"https://beebom.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/cleanmgr_oWjqZQHbhd.jpg\" /></p>\n\n<p>4. Now, scroll down and go through all the temporary files and folders. Enable the checkbox if you want to remove those particular files and click &ldquo;OK&rdquo;. Yet again, we suggest&nbsp;<strong>keeping everything checked</strong>. And that&rsquo;s how you can remove temp files through Disk Cleanup on your Windows 11 PC.</p>\n\n<p><img alt=\"cleanmgr\" src=\"https://beebom.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/105.jpg?w=375\" style=\"height:470px; width:375px\" /></p>\n\n<p>Method 3: Remove Temp Files in Windows 11 Manually</p>\n\n<p>Now, if you are a veteran Windows user, you might know how to access the Temp folder manually. However, if you are new to Windows 11 and want to learn how to access the Temp files manually, here&rsquo;s how to do it:</p>\n\n<p>1. First, press the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://beebom.com/windows-11-keyboard-shortcuts/\">Windows 11 keyboard shortcut</a>&nbsp;&ldquo;<strong>Win + R</strong>&rdquo; to open the Run prompt. Here, type&nbsp;<code>%temp%</code>&nbsp;and hit Enter.</p>\n\n<p><img alt=\"Remove Temp Files in Windows 11 Manually\" src=\"https://beebom.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/92.jpg?w=399\" style=\"height:206px; width:399px\" /></p>\n\n<p>2. It will open the Windows&nbsp;<strong>Temp folder</strong>&nbsp;location in your user directory.</p>\n\n<p><img alt=\"Remove Temp Files in Windows 11 Manually\" src=\"https://beebom.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/93.jpg?w=640\" style=\"height:462px; width:640px\" /></p>\n\n<p>3. Now,&nbsp;<strong>select all the files</strong>&nbsp;using the Ctrl + A keyboard shortcut and delete them. That&rsquo;s is another easy way to delete the Temp files in Windows 11. You might encounter some errors saying some files can&rsquo;t be deleted. You can safely skip such prompts. The error generally occurs when a program is still using that particular temporary file.</p>\n\n<p><img alt=\"Remove Temp Files in Windows 11 Manually\" src=\"https://beebom.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/94.jpg?w=640\" style=\"height:462px; width:640px\" /></p>\n\n<p>Method 4: Delete Temp Files From Windows 11 via Command Prompt</p>\n\n<p>1. Another way to completely delete temp files from Windows 11 is through the Command Prompt. Press the Windows key once and type &ldquo;cmd&rdquo; and open a&nbsp;<strong>Command Prompt</strong>&nbsp;window by clicking on &ldquo;Run as administrator&rdquo; in the right pane of the search results. By the way, you can also open Command Prompt inside&nbsp;<a href=\"https://beebom.com/how-customize-windows-terminal-2/\">Windows Terminal (which you greatly customize to your liking)</a>.</p>\n\n<p><img alt=\"Delete Temp Files From Windows 11 Using Command Prompt\" src=\"https://beebom.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/100.jpg?w=551\" style=\"height:560px; width:551px\" /></p>\n\n<p>2. Next, copy the below command and right-click on the CMD window to&nbsp;<strong>paste the command</strong>.</p>\n\n<pre>\ndel /q/f/s %TEMP%*</pre>\n\n<p><img alt=\"del /q/f/s %TEMP%*\" src=\"https://beebom.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/103.jpg?w=428\" style=\"height:237px; width:428px\" /></p>\n\n<p>3. Now, simply&nbsp;<strong>hit Enter</strong>, and the entire heap of Temp files will be deleted from Windows 11.</p>\n\n<p><img alt=\"temp files\" src=\"https://beebom.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/104.jpg?w=640\" style=\"height:335px; width:640px\" /></p>\n\n<p>Method 5: Automatically Delete Windows 11 Temp Files Using Storage Sense</p>\n\n<p>In case you find the whole process tedious, you can enable a setting in Windows 11 that will take care of cleaning up temporary files automatically. Here is how to go about it.</p>\n\n<p>1. Press the Windows key, type &ldquo;storage sense&rdquo;, and open the &ldquo;<strong>Turn on Storage Sense</strong>&rdquo; system setting.</p>\n\n<p><img alt=\"Automatically Delete Windows 11 Temp Files Using Storage Sense\" src=\"https://beebom.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/106.jpg?w=556\" style=\"height:560px; width:556px\" /></p>\n\n<p>2. Next,&nbsp;<strong>enable the toggle</strong>&nbsp;for &ldquo;Storage Sense&rdquo; in Windows 11 settings.</p>\n\n<p><img alt=\"Automatically Delete Windows 11 Temp Files Using Storage Sense\" src=\"https://beebom.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/107.jpg?w=640\" style=\"height:233px; width:640px\" /></p>\n\n<p>3. After that, open the Storage Sense menu, and here you can configure everything. You can choose when to run Storage Sense, configure it to not delete your downloaded files, and more. This way, you don&rsquo;t have to follow any of the manual methods listed above.</p>\n\n<p><img alt=\"Automatically Delete Windows 11 Temp Files Using Storage Sense\" src=\"https://beebom.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/108.jpg?w=640\" style=\"height:444px; width:640px\" /></p>\n\n<h3>Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)</h3>\n\n<p><strong>Q.

The device, which has been leaked several times in the past, is an affordable variant of the Galaxy S21 and a successor to last year&rsquo;s Galaxy S20 FE. It is aimed to bring the Galaxy S-series&rsquo; premium features at a relatively affordable price point. Here are the details.</p>\n\n<h2>Galaxy S21 FE: Specs and Features</h2>\n\n<p>The Galaxy S21 FE, as&nbsp;<a href=\"https://beebom.com/samsung-galaxy-s21-fe-3d-renders-color-variants/\">rumored previously</a>, comes with a&nbsp;<strong>Galaxy S21-like design</strong>&nbsp;with a vertical rear camera hump that blends into the matte-finished back panel. However, it goes for a plastic build for the obvious cost-cutting reasons. It comes in four colors, namely Olive, Lavender, White, and Graphite. Upfront, there is a center-placed punch-hole screen.</p>\n\n<p>The screen spans 6.4-inch and supports a Full HD+ screen resolution. It is a<strong>&nbsp;Dynamic AMOLED 2X display that gets up to a 120Hz</strong>&nbsp;<strong>refresh rate</strong>&nbsp;and a 240Hz touch sampling rate. The Galaxy S21 FE 5G is powered by a Qualcomm Snapdragon 888 mobile platform and comes in three RAM + storage configurations: 6GB+128GB, 8GB+128GB, and 8GB+256GB.</p>\n\n<p><img alt=\"samsung galaxy s21 fe in lavender, graphite, olive, and white colors launched\" src=\"https://beebom.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/galaxy-s21-fe-1.jpg?w=750\" style=\"height:500px; width:750px\" /></p>\n\n<p>As for the cameras, there are three at the back, including a&nbsp;<strong>12MP primary snapper with OIS and dual-pixel AF</strong>, a 12MP ultra-wide camera with an FoV of 123-degrees, and an 8MP telephoto lens with support for up to 30x Space Zoom. The front camera stands at 32MP. This is pretty much similar to its predecessor from last year. There are various camera features at our disposal, including, Night mode, AI Face Restoration, dual-video recording, and more.</p>\n\n<p>The Galaxy S21 FE 5G is backed by a&nbsp;<strong>4,500mAh battery with support for 25W fast charging</strong>, 15W wireless charging, and wireless PowerShare functionality. It runs Samsung One UI 4.0 based on Android 12 out-of-the-box, which is a first for a Samsung phone.</p>\n\n<p>There&rsquo;s support for 5G (of course), an optical in-display fingerprint scanner, IP68 water and dust resistance, Samsung Pay with NFC, and more.</p>\n\n<h2>Price and Availability</h2>\n\n<p>The Samsung Galaxy S21 FE starts at $699 (around Rs 52,139), which is similar to the Galaxy S20 FE price when it was launched. It will be available to buy, starting January 11, but the date of availability will differ for different markets. There&rsquo;s no word on its availability in India just yet, but we can expect it to launch here soon.</p>\n\n<p>Are you going to buy the new Galaxy S21 FE 5G?
